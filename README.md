# Project Name

Photo Gallery using REACT 

## Description

Duration: 6hrs

Objective: 

To create an app where the user can see a gallery of pictures. Each picture should show a description when clicked on. In addition, below each picture the user can interact with a like button and below the like button a total of likes should be displayed. 

Problems encoutered:

- Decide what props to share with each component

    Solution: 
   
    - Shared props as I built the functionalities of each component and deleted props that were not going to be used in a specific component

- Fixing a bug in the PUR request - client side

    Solution: 

    - Decided to place the house the PUT request in the App.jsx file and share it with the GalleryItem component
    - Gave the function a parameter of a item.id to excute the request
    

Next Steps: 

- Use a database for all the picture infomation
- Create a form where you can upload picture to the gallery from yoa local computer
